## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Identify the app to providers: send a `talkative/<version>` user-agent on every outbound provider request and OpenRouter app-attribution headers (`HTTP-Referer`, `X-OpenRouter-Title`, `X-OpenRouter-Categories`) so Talkative shows up in OpenRouter rankings and analytics.
- Link the composer's "not reported by this provider" thinking note to Settings → Models, deep-linking to the model via a `?model=` search prefill on /settings/providers.
